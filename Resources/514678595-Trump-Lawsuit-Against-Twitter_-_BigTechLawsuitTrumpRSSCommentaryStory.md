My show RSS Commentary, indie news and political commentary from the Intellectual dark web, was unlawfully defamed by big tech using ai bots that recklessly censored my class, indie news and political commentary on the behalf of advertisers and Democrat politicians who big tech knows are not going to break up their monopoly based on silicon valley, where Kamala Harris severed as Senator and Attorney General.

BIG TECH used RUSSIAgate as an excuse to perform election engineering using a secret back door portal to big tech's censorship engine programmed by far-left silicon valley programmers. This censorship engine was used by a shadow campaign that engineered and determined the outcome of the 2020 election in private. The outcome of the 2020 election was determined by acts such as the secret meetings with the shadow campaign and big tech CEOs, and Mark Zuckerberg's $500 million donation to pay for ballot harvesting in swing states and pay for election officials and judge's salaries.
