## NetChoice v. Paxton

1. Social media platforms have transformed the way people communicate with each other and obtain news.1

1. First, Texas contends that §7 does not require social media platforms to host any particular message but only to refrain from discrimination against a user’s speech on the basis of “viewpoint,” App. 49a, and in this respect the statute may be a permissible attempt to prevent “repression of [the freedom of speech] by private interests,” Associated Press v. United States, 326 U. S. 1, 20 (1945). 

1. It is not freedom of speech for Big tech to censor our speech and discriminate against us based on viewpoint because Big tech is so large that they would then own the speech of nearly the entire country.

1. In Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio, 471 U.S. 626, 651 (1985), the Court upheld laws requiring that businesses disclose “purely factual and uncontroversial information about the terms under which [their] services will be available,” so long as those requirements are not “unjustified or unduly burdensome.”

1. “[w]hen the platforms resort to section 230’s protections . . . they are relying on Congress’s determinations that they are not the ‘publisher’ of their users’ content, 47 U.S.C. §230(c)(1), and that they are not ‘responsible’ for that content in any respect, id. §230(f )(3).” Response 36. And Texas suggests that,given that many of applicants’ members have emphasized their “ ‘neutral[ity]’ ” and their function as “ ‘conduits’ ” for the speech of their users (see id., at 37–38, and nn. 11–18), the Court should view their assertions of a First Amendment right to engage in “ ‘editorial discretion’ ” with some skepticism.

1. While I can understand the Court’s apparent desire to delay enforcement of HB20 while the appeal is pending, the preliminary injunction entered by the DistrictCourt was itself a significant intrusion on state sovereignty, and Texas should not be required to seek preclearance from the federal courts before its laws go into effect.

1. public institutions sometimes have a constitutional obligation to host speakers that they would rather reject, see, e.g.,
Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263 (1981).

1. NetChoice, LLC v. Moody noted that “FAIR and PruneYard establish
that compelling a person to allow a visitor access to the person’s property, for the purpose of speaking, is not a First Amendment violation, so long as the person is not compelled to speak, the person is not restricted from speaking, and the message of the visitor is not likely to be attributed to the person.”143

1. Big Tech platforms are “open to the public” that is not “limited to the personal use” of the platforms."

1. Such an ability by property owners to “expressly disavow any connection with the message” (a message that is itself clearly written by others), and to point out that the message is only allowed “by virtue of [the] law,”192 suffices to prevent any First Amendment violation based on the possibility of misattribution. Observers can be expected to “appreciate the difference between speech [the property owner] sponsors and speech the school permits because legally required to do so, pursuant to an equal access policy,” especially when nothing “restricts what the [property owner] may say about” the third party’s speech.193 And the same is true for platforms, which can easily inform readers that they aren’t endorsing particular writers, or more generally that they aren’t endorsing speech on their sites as a whole.194

1. Twitter champions itself as “the free speech wing of the free speech party.”

1. Twitter unapologetically argues that it could turn around and ban all pro-LGBT speech for no other reason than its employees want to pick on members of that community, Oral Arg. at 22:39–22:52.

1. Texas Legislators found while passing HB 20 that “social media platforms with the largest number of users are common carriers by virtue of their market dominance.”

1. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 143A.002(a). “Censor” means “to block, ban, remove, deplatform, demonetize, de-boost, restrict, deny equal access or visibility to, or otherwise discriminate against expression.” Id. § 143A.001(1). For Section 7 to apply, a censored user must reside in Texas, do business in Texas, or share or receive expression in Texas. Id. § 143A.004(a)–(b).

1. Instead, their challenge is premised on First Amendment overbreadth doctrine. Under this doctrine, the Supreme Court has “recognized a second type of facial challenge, whereby a law may be invalidated as overbroad if a substantial number of its applications are unconstitutional, judged in relation to the statute’s plainly legitimate sweep.” Bonta, 141 S. Ct. at 2387 (quotation omitted). This doctrine is limited to “the First Amendment context.” Ibid.

1. “Overbreadth is a judicially created doctrine designed to prevent the chilling of protected expression.” Massachusetts v. Oakes, 491 U.S. 576, 584 (1989) (plurality op.); see generally Lewis D. Sargentich, Note, The First Amendment Overbreadth Doctrine, 83 Harv. L. Rev. 844 (1970). As the seminal case explained, the overbreadth doctrine addresses “threat[s] to censure comments on matters of public concern.” Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 U.S. 88, 97 (1940). The doctrine’s rationale is that “[m]any persons, rather than undertake the considerable burden (and sometimes risk) of vindicating their rights through case-by-case litigation, will choose simply to abstain from protected speech—harming not only themselves but society as a whole, which is deprived of an uninhibited marketplace of ideas.” Virginia v. Hicks, 539 U.S. 113, 119 (2003) (citation omitted).
